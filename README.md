## Projects and work done in 2025



### Data management
- Documented and modelled all company processes using BPMN 2.0 methodology, identifying bottlenecks and proposing improvements or automation opportunities.
- Created and maintained repositories in SharePoint and OneNote to track infrastructure changes and ensure knowledge traceability.
- Established a logical classification and filing structure (decimal method) across tools (SharePoint, OneNote, ERP) to standardize documentation and facilitate retrieval.
- Developed internal compliance and HR documents (Code of Conduct, Internal Regulation, GDPR notice, Social Security notice, legal information memo) ensuring alignment with legal and regulatory frameworks.
- Acted as Data Steward, monitoring data flows, guaranteeing integrity, and supporting the sustainability rating upgrade (from D to B) by providing structured, reliable datasets.
- Supported ERP transition (GekOS) by testing modules, suggesting improvements, and ensuring that process documentation matched the new system’s logic.


## What I learned
- I absolutely abhor lazy HR people who rely exclusively on ATS to do their work with every fibre of my being.
- Data management is my strong suit → Process modelling, classification systems, and documentation bring clarity and structure, and I enjoy driving improvements in this area.
- ERP projects are messy but rewarding → Beta testing, negotiating with vendors, and aligning tools with business processes requires, persistence, and diplomacy.
- Compliance adds weight but builds trust → Writing internal regulations, GDPR notices, and codes of conduct made me realize how essential clear governance is.
- Safety matters → QHSE training reminded me that workplace safety is not a box-ticking exercise but an ongoing awareness effort. And you can avoid people being killed.
- Sustainability is a long game → Upgrading ratings and launching certifications (B Corp, labels) is less about quick wins and more about steady, structured progress.
- No-code ≠ no effort → Tools that promise simplicity still demand technical adaptability and a problem-solving mindset.
